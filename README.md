# SprintProject by Blake Legge
#work in progress but this is a SpringBoot REST CRUD application that hosts a MySQL database on a server.
#posting, getting and deleting has been implemented, putting was implemented but got broken somehow so it was removed
#I had issues with setting up a GUI so I attemped a text based interface but had some hiccups with that aswell. I am working on getting that working ASAP and will be continuing
#to work on this until it is fully functioning through a basic command line interface.
